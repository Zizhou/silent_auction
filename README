silent auction prototype

allows for anonymous users to participate, registration not required
registered users will auto-fill info

probably super insecure
there's probably some inevitable issues with time zones when using admin page


use cron or equivalent to run check_active command (ideally every minute?) to mark auctions inactive if past end time


DEPENDENCIES: pytz

add ROBOT_MAILER and ROBOT_PASSWORD to settings.py because I am lazy
